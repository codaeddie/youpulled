I was working quite a lot during the Christmas and New Year, eating and I did quite a lot of cooking and helping in my parents' restaurant. Okay, what uh what sort of stuff were you cooking described and how you were doing it? I was cooking carp was the Czechs, that Czech tradition. Coffee yes. As in a fish. Yes. Bread crumbed and then pan fried. It's served with potato salad and Czech lager. Czech vaga? Yes. Hungarian vaga? No. Okay. Um were you cooking anything else? No. Okay. Um tell me about what you did on Christmas Day. Well, I slept till about 2:30 in the afternoon, so I didn't really have much of the day. Right, but then you've surely got up and had Christmas meal and stuff. I had that on the 24th in the evening. Oh, right. Yes. Why is that? Is that Hungarian tradition or Czech tradition? I'm sorry, I thought you were Hungarian. No, I'm not Hungarian, I'm afraid. Well, oh no, that's really bad. I'm very sorry. That's okay. Um so why is why is the meal sort of served on Christmas Eve right now? Because they open their presents in the evening on the Christmas Eve that the Czechs do so that's why they have it like this. Right. Okay, that's simple. Um so you didn't get a chance to go away or anything? No. No, boo. Alright, tell me about uh what you have to school. Pardon. Uh what are you up to at school then? Well we mainly work. Describe some of the stuff. Art is always good. Well I just had to draw and paint things, sort of doing that, really. Okay, what about uh have you learned anything interesting in history? No. Alright. Um what about uh describe your journey here? Well, I just sat in the train, came here, sat in a tube, got to the nearest station and walked ten minutes. Okay. Right. Okay, describe where you live. I live in Northampton, which is in England. I live up by my parents' restaurant. Tell me about the area room. Well it's mainly shops and restaurants around. So for the old. Is it a nice area or is it a good place to grow? Commercial. Commercial. Yes. Was it a good place to grow up or is that what you have you always lived there? I've always lived there yes. So tell me about kind of growing up around there and stuff and well I just stayed home most of the time so there's not really much to grow up about. Um all right have you seen any films or T V shows or anything you could tell me about? Well the men fell off. Right, okay. Um what about um about sort of bed which is high above the ground so I can store things underneath I've got three tables in my room to work on I have snails as a pet and stick insects as a pet. I can't imagine they're terribly dynamic pets are they? They're perfectly normal pets. Oh okay. You don't take them out for walks and stuff. No. Stick insects are about this big of course and snails they're this big. So how can I I'll put them on a lead like a dog. Come on. Why don't you decide to have snails as I don't know. Did you kind of like go out and buy them or did you sort of like well I found the snails in my back garden and I bought my stick insects.\n"
